Steps so far on progress

1. Understanding what to predict, fundamental understanding on the features in database
2. begun to preproccess the data 
3. began to choose a ai model to use
4. data is processed into a useable numerical format
5. first model, "brokenModel" is created, with an R squared of -0.3
6. Random forest regressor is used as a secondary machine learning model
7. heat map is made to see band gaps correlation between all features inside the numerical data set. 
8. ten features are used in both models
"nsites", "nelements", "is_gap_direct", "cbm", "energy_per_atom", 
"is_metal","efermi" ,"vbm" ,"formation_energy_per_atom","density".
These features obtained R-squared values of 0.99. RandomForestRegressor is 
9. Testing to see potential overfitting. More Preprocessing
10. Prepoccessing new data to predict new values
11. Choosing new continuous attributes to predict (potentially Density, Density Atomic, Formation Entry Per Atom)
12. Created Test model for predicting density
13. Created a new model to predict if an element is stable. r squared of 1.0
14. Began creating model for predicting VBM using full numerical dataset
